# Error-Metrics
## Investigation of Performance Metrics in Regression Analysis and ML based PredictionÂ Model
Performance metrics, also known as evaluation metrics or error metrics, are essential 
elements of machine learning- and regression analysis-based prediction models. A logical and 
mathematical construct called a performance metric is used to gauge how closely the 
anticipated results match actual results. Outcome refers to the outcome. In the literature, 
several performance metrics have been suggested and detailed. To make the creation and 
application of the metrics simpler, knowledge regarding their qualities needs to be 
institutionalised. In this study, we look at 14 different regression-related metrics, including the 
most popular ones like the (root) mean squared error, mean absolute error, Pearson 
correlation coefficient, and coefficient of determination, among many others.
Through theoretical analysis and a thorough numerical example, we present their 
mathematical formulations as well as a discussion on their application, characteristics, 
benefits, and drawbacks. The 10 unitless metrics are further examined through a numerical 
analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation that I add random noise with different noise ratios to 
the anticipated values, and (ii) is based on random guessing and (ii) random guessing. As 
evaluation measures of the "goodness of fit," some of the metrics exhibit poor or inconsistent 
performance, while others exhibit good performance. We highlight the significance of using 
the appropriate metrics in machine learning and regression models generally to generate 
accurate predictions.
